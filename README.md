# NetSentry

## Background

The current state of modern network logging software (think Wireshark) provides an interface to monitor oneâ€™s network activity. While these solutions can accurately log such data, it is difficult to filter, monitor, and analyze packets in their raw format. Additionally, it becomes practically impossible for a user to manually analyze the hundreds of packets logged every few seconds for threat detection.

**Butâ€¦ AI can help with this! ðŸ˜Š**

## Our Solution

We built a multi-modal network logger to detect security threats in real-time, along with an interactive user experience to further understand, analyze, and prevent security threats on a computer.

### Initial User Experience

The user begins by providing a description, in natural language, of what they will be using their network for, along with any security concerns they might have. This query is sent to a multi-agent workflow to generate an initial filtering criteria for our network logger. This screening reduces the high volume of logs to a relevant subset of network activity.

### Multi-Agent Workflow

This criteria is selected or generated through a multi-agent workflow:

1. **Criteria Selector Agent:** Takes the userâ€™s query and cross-references a repository of pre-defined criteria to find a valid match.
2. **Examiner Agent:** Reviews whether the selected criteria is an accurate filter for the query.
3. **Criteria Generation Agent:** If the Examiner is unsatisfied, this agent generates a new criteria that fits the userâ€™s specific use case. The new output is then re-examined for accuracy.

We designed a **cyclic graph structure** of agents to ensure accuracy and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Additionally, when the Criteria Generation Agent defines a new criteria, it writes it to the initial criteria repository, allowing future references by the Criteria Selector Agent. This ensures our agentic system remains **stateful** and dynamically improves over time.

### Packet Sniffing & Analysis Workflow

To sniff packets on the client side, we built a **cross-platform desktop application** using **Electron**, which runs Python-executable scripts for network packet sniffing. These packets are streamed to our server, where they enter a **second multi-agent workflow for threat detection analysis:**

1. Root Node: Sends the packet into three specialized worker nodes:
   - XSS Agent
   - SQL Injection Agent
   - Payload Agent
2. Each worker examines the packet in its area of expertise and generates feedback.
3. The feedback is synthesized by a **terminal node** to make a final security decision.

Unlike the first workflow, this **packet analysis workflow prioritizes speed **by parallelizing LLM processes. While the first workflow resembles an **undirected cyclic graph**, this one is a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**. The analysis output and packet metadata are displayed in a **real-time dashboard** for users.

### Querying Log History with RAG

After analysis, the packetâ€™s metadata and analysis output are embedded and stored in a **vector database**. Users can query their logs using **semantic search** in natural language. The system retrieves and formats relevant results for easy understanding.

### Actionable Threat Resolution

Real-time threat detection is crucial, but users need clear steps to resolve malicious activity. Our app includes a **diagram-generation feature** that presents **actionable steps** and a **visual implementation guide** for addressing security threats.
